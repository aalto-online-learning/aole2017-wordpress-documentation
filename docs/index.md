# onlinelearning.aalto.fi 2017
**Wordpress usage guide**


This guide helps you in updating the <onlinelearning.aalto.fi> page. Each page on the site is a page in this documentation. For example: if you want to know how to add new pilots on the Pilots-page, you should look at the [Pilots-page](page-pilots.md) documentation page.

Besides the guides for regular users, I have also included a [For developers](developers.md) documentation page. While not very extensive, it might help future developers in further developing the Wordpress site.

Best,
Aleksi Taipale
