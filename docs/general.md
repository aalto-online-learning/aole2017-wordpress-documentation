Here, you will find guidelines that can be applied in multiple places on the site.

#### A) From the `Pages`-menu

Click ![](assets/page-home-a60dbed9.png) on the left side of the Wordpress dashboard and then click edit in the box which looks like below (for whichever page you want to edit):

Another option is to hover your mouse on the left over the corresponding content type's menu, and click `Add New`:
